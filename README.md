# Windows File Explorer Clone

**Microsoft please don't ban me for using Windows Icons, Segoe UI font and Windows 10 wallpaper. This project is't commercial and is only for learning purposes.**

This is a demo of partially working Windows 10 file explorer recreated in Angular. Right now I've done only most of UI and provided basic files browsing.

I don't promise, but in the future, I'd like to implement most of explorer features (make most of buttons on ribbon working, add selection, context menus etc.).

This is how it looks like (if you don't trust me, check out online version).

I'm not going to add RWD, so please run this project only on PC.
